<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a research engineer on Computer Vision, which consists of 3D Computer Vision, Scene Understanding, and AR/VR applications.
Previously, I received Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng), advised by [Prof. Jongwoo Lim](https://rvlab.snu.ac.kr/people/jwlim). I completed my Bachelor‚Äôs degree at Vietnam National University of Hanoi.

I'm a royal fan of Chelsea Football Club and the music of Thomas Bergersen. I also wanna become an engineer, AI architect, scientist, programmer, troublemaker, manager, revisionist, analyst, academic, salesman, entrepreneur, data analyst, product owner, evangelist, debater, musician, biker, a husband, and a father as well. Probably forgot a few.
